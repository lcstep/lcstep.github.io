			<h1>The Control of Nature</h1>
			<h2>John McPhee</h2>
			<p>My mother recommended Los Angeles Against the Mountains—the final essay in this collection—on a trip out west last February. I had pulled a muscle in my back the week before, so we walked up into the San Gabriel on a hike to give it exercise. The mountains hummed with heat and the trapped potential energy of valley and slope. Much of McPhee's writing is about the improbability of Los Angeles against such forbidding land. He carries that theme to Iceland and the Atchafalaya river, which wants very much to eat the Mississippi, depriving New Orleans of her harbor. He has a beat on our misguided works of ingenuity, which he doesn't let get in the way of his awe at those works. I adored McPhee for his humor and cleverness, and for his wonder at the world. If you are like me and your mind is constantly awhirr with anxiety about people, you may find his preoccupation with the land soothing. Geology is, after all, on a different scale. It has been here, and will be here. </p>
