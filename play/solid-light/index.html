			<p>Pioneer Works is pleased to present Anthony McCall’s Solid Light Works, opening on January 12, 2018. This exhibition marks the artist’s first institutional exhibition in New York and first time that his vertical installations will be shown alongside their horizontal variants. Requiring over thirty feet of clearance from floor to ceiling, very few New York venues can accommodate these six-colossal works. The epic vertical and horizontal installations will fill Pioneer Works’ monumental main hall, which will be completely blacked out and immersed in haze.</p>
