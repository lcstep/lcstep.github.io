		        	<p>Dadeland, Florida is an unlikely location for one of Miami’s hottest restaurants. But here, across from the sleepy suburb’s sprawling namesake mall, reservations at chef Niven Patel’s Ghee Indian Kitchen have become some of the most sought after in town. Patel, 34, opened his restaurant in May 2017, and by the first week of September, he was riding high, a second location in the Design District imminent. Then came Hurricane Irma, which shut down his restaurant for four days. “Usually we're like, ‘We'll weather the storm.’” he says. “But this one, a lot of people were bracing for even worse than what happened.” Fortunately, there was no flooding and by late October, both Ghees were in full operation and thriving under the chef’s masterful cooking.</p>

					<p>Customers will fight city traffic, endure hours-long waits and even accept al fresco seating amidst tropical storms just to experience Patel’s modern Gujarat-inspired fare. And while there is much acclaim for his main menu, the desserts — think chai-spiced chocolate cake and creamy kulfi made with fresh mangoes and coconuts — are what diners stick around for.</p>

					<p>The way Patel eats at home with his family is very different from what people generally find when going out for Indian food. “We wanted to bring that into the restaurant — more homestyle flavors and dishes, but incorporating local, fresh ingredients,” he says. The same goes for the desserts; Ghee offers approachable, familiar ones as well as traditional regional options that many locals haven't tried before, like his purple potato roti made with tubers sourced from his own backyard farm, Rancho Patel.</p>

	            <p>Early in his cooking career, Patel spent three years working the garde manger station, preparing cold dishes. Finally, to get out of making salads, he volunteered to work pastry, thinking it would be easy. “It was harder than I thought,” he says. “I cook by feel — there's still a lot of that in pastry, but you have to be more precise with calculations. It was probably the best thing I did in my career long term.”</p>

				<p>Halwa is a traditional Indian pudding that’s usually made with carrot and cream and spiced with cardamom. For the fall season, Patel substituted pumpkin as the base, creating a comforting, mildly sweet dessert.</p>

				<p>Along with his staff of four cooks and a pastry chef, Patel works closely with his wife, Shivani, and his in-laws, Indira and Santosh, who all contribute to the day-to-day restaurant operations. Indira often provides extra discipline in the kitchen and even helps roll out the roti.</p>

		        <p>Patel started growing vegetables as a hobby when he was cooking at a brasserie on Grand Cayman that had a full farm. “I’ve always connected with farmers at every restaurant I worked with and just love and appreciate what they all do,” says Patel, who built his two-acre farm behind his house in the Miami suburb of Homestead. Though he still sources seasonal ingredients like pumpkin from local farmers, his goal is to provide both his restaurants with 60 percent of their produce.</p>
